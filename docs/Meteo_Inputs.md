# Hapi Inputs

The required inputs for the distributed model is divided into Meteorological, GIS inputs and Distributed model parameters

## Meteorological Inputs

To be able to run the hydrologic simulation with Hapi the following meteorological inputs are required 

	- rainfall

	- evapotranspiration

	- Temperature

Distributed meteorological data can be obtain from gauge data with some interpolation method or from remote sensing data

## Remote Sensing Module

The remote sensing module includes two classes to download ECMWF, and CHRIPS data

### CHRIPS

The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a quasi-global rainfall data set. As its title suggests it combines data from real-time observing meteorological stations with infra-red data to estimate precipitation. The data set runs from 1981 to the near present.

CHIRPS incorporates 0.05° resolution satellite imagery with in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring

There are two main data sets. The first is quasi-global and covers the whole world from 50°N to 50°S. The second covers Africa and parts of the Middle-East. It covers the area from 40°N to 40°S and from 20°W to 55°E. The global data set has data on a 0.05° grid at monthly, pentad and daily times steps. This is equivalent to 31 km2. The ‘Africa’ data set also includes data at a 0.10° grid at a 6-hour time step.

CHRIPS data are uploaded into a ftp server therefore and can be downloaded through the `CHRIPS` class in the `remotesensing` module

	- First import the class from the mremotesensing module

	```
	from Hapi.remotesensing import CHIRPS
	```
	- Create the object with the following information
		- Period of time (start and end date)
		- Temporal resolution (daily/monthy)
		- Extend (Longitude/Latitude)
		- Path (directory to save the downloaded data)

```
	StartDate = '2009-01-01'
	EndDate = '2009-02-01'
	Time = 'daily'
	lat = [4.190755,4.643963]
	lon = [-75.649243,-74.727286]
	Path = "directory to save the data"
```
## Parameters

You will find the following example in the `ExtractParametersBounds.py` file under the folder `/Examples/Create Inputs`. There is no need for copy paste work.

To Extract the parameters range needed for the Calibration you have to prepare a shapefile of the catchment you are developing a distributed model and read it using `geopandas`, 

	import geopandas as gpd
	import numpy as np
	import pandas as pd
	import Hapi.inputs as IN

	BasinF = "Path to shapefile"
	Basin = gpd.read_file(BasinF)
	# parameters name with the same order inside the Input module
	ind = ["tt","sfcf","cfmax","cwh","cfr","fc","beta","lp","k0","k1","k2","uzl","perc","maxbas"]
	Par = pd.DataFrame(index = ind)

the `inputs` module in Hapi has a `ExtractParametersBoundaries` method to overlay the basin shapefile with the global parameters rasters and extract the max and min parameter values within the basin and plots your basin shapefile in top of the world map to make sure of the projection transformation from whatever projection your basin shapefile to the `WGS64` that the parameters rasters have

	# extract parameters boundaries
	Par['UB'], Par['LB'] = IN.ExtractParametersBoundaries(Basin)

To extract the parameters from one of the ten scenarios developed to derive the Global model `ExtractParameters` method takes the number of the scenario as a string and return the parameters

	# extract parameters in a specific scenarion from the 10 scenarios
	Par['1'] = IN.ExtractParameters(Basin,"01")

the extracted parameters needs to be modified incase you are not considering the snow bucket the first 5 parameters are disregarded
