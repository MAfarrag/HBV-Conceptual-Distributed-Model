# Hapi Inputs

The required inputs for the distributed model is divided into Meteorological, GIS inputs and Distributed model parameters

![process](../img/process.png)

## Meteorological Inputs

To be able to run the hydrologic simulation with Hapi the following meteorological inputs are required 

	- rainfall

	- evapotranspiration

	- Temperature

Distributed meteorological data can be obtain from gauge data with some interpolation method or from remote sensing data

## Remote Sensing Module

The remote sensing module includes two classes to download ECMWF, and CHRIPS data

### CHRIPS

The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a quasi-global rainfall data set. As its title suggests it combines data from real-time observing meteorological stations with infra-red data to estimate precipitation. The data set runs from 1981 to the near present.

CHIRPS incorporates 0.05° resolution satellite imagery with in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring

There are two main data sets. The first is quasi-global and covers the whole world from 50°N to 50°S. The second covers Africa and parts of the Middle-East. It covers the area from 40°N to 40°S and from 20°W to 55°E. The global data set has data on a 0.05° grid at monthly, pentad and daily times steps. This is equivalent to 31 km2. The ‘Africa’ data set also includes data at a 0.10° grid at a 6-hour time step.

CHRIPS data are uploaded into a ftp server therefore and can be downloaded through the `CHRIPS` class in the `remotesensing` module

- First import the class from the remotesensing module

	```
	from Hapi.remotesensing import CHIRPS
	```


- Create the object with the following information
	- Period of time (start and end date)
	- Temporal resolution (daily/monthy)
	- Extend (Longitude/Latitude)
	- Path (directory to save the downloaded data)

	
		StartDate = '2009-01-01'
		EndDate = '2009-01-10'
		Time = 'daily'
		lat = [4.190755,4.643963]
		lon = [-75.649243,-74.727286]
		Path = "directory to save the data"
		Coello = CHIRPS(StartDate=StartDate, EndDate=EndDate, Time=Time,
        	    	latlim=lat , lonlim=lon, Path=Path)
	

- Call the `Download` method 

		Coello.Download()
	
- A Progress bar will appear and be updated with percent of the download

	![process](../img/progressbar.png)
	

- If the period is long and the Download method can run in parallel, to activate the parallel mode enter the number of cores with the keyword argument `cores`

	```
	Coello.Download(cores=4)
	```

### ECMWF

ERA-Interim data set is a global atmospheric reanalysis that is available from 1 January 1979 to 31 August 2019

The ERA-Interim data assimilation and forecast suite produces:
• four analyses per day, at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC;
• two 10-day forecasts per day, initialized from analyses at 00 and 12 UTC

- Most archived ERA-Interim data can be downloaded from the ECMWF Data Server at http://data.ecmwf.int/data.
- The ERA-Interim Archive is part of ECMWF’s Meteorological Archive and Retrieval System (MARS), which is accessible to registered users
- The RemoteSensing and the ECMWF classes can retrieve  the data from the ECMWF servers, if you are registered and setup the API Key in your machine


so inorder to be able to use the following code to download ECMWF data you need to 
- register and setup your account in the ECMWF website (https://apps.ecmwf.int/registration/)
-  Install ECMWF key (instruction are here https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets#AccessECMWFPublicDatasets-key)

- ERA-Interim data set has a lot of meteorological variables which you can download
- You need to provide the name of the variable using the `Variables` object 
- `Variables` contains the tame of the variable you need to give to the `ECMWF` object to get and the unit and description

		from Hapi.remotesensing import Variables
		Vars = Variables('daily')
		Vars.__str__()

## Parameters

You will find the following example in the `ExtractParametersBounds.py` file under the folder `/Examples/Create Inputs`. There is no need for copy paste work.

To Extract the parameters range needed for the Calibration you have to prepare a shapefile of the catchment you are developing a distributed model and read it using `geopandas`, 

	import geopandas as gpd
	import numpy as np
	import pandas as pd
	import Hapi.inputs as IN

	BasinF = "Path to shapefile"
	Basin = gpd.read_file(BasinF)
	# parameters name with the same order inside the Input module
	ind = ["tt","sfcf","cfmax","cwh","cfr","fc","beta","lp","k0","k1","k2","uzl","perc","maxbas"]
	Par = pd.DataFrame(index = ind)

the `inputs` module in Hapi has a `ExtractParametersBoundaries` method to overlay the basin shapefile with the global parameters rasters and extract the max and min parameter values within the basin and plots your basin shapefile in top of the world map to make sure of the projection transformation from whatever projection your basin shapefile to the `WGS64` that the parameters rasters have

	# extract parameters boundaries
	Par['UB'], Par['LB'] = IN.ExtractParametersBoundaries(Basin)

To extract the parameters from one of the ten scenarios developed to derive the Global model `ExtractParameters` method takes the number of the scenario as a string and return the parameters

	# extract parameters in a specific scenarion from the 10 scenarios
	Par['1'] = IN.ExtractParameters(Basin,"01")

the extracted parameters needs to be modified incase you are not considering the snow bucket the first 5 parameters are disregarded
